# AI Learns to Play Snake Game using Q-learning üêçüß†

Welcome to the AI Snake Game project! In this project, an AI agent learns to play the classic Snake game using Q-learning, a popular reinforcement learning algorithm.

## Introduction
This project demonstrates how an AI agent can learn to play the Snake game using Q-learning. Through trial and error, the agent improves its strategy to achieve higher scores over time.

## Features
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Utilizes Q-learning to train the AI agent.
- **Classic Snake Game**: The agent plays the traditional Snake game.
- **Visualization**: See the AI in action as it learns and plays the game.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone this repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ananya868/Ai-Learns-to-Play-Snake-Game-using-Q-Learning-Approach.git
cd Ai-Learns-to-Play-Snake-Game-using-Q-Learning-Approach
```
  
## Usage
To start training the AI agent, run:
```bash
python game.py
```

## How It Works
- **Q-learning**: A reinforcement learning algorithm where the agent learns the value of taking certain actions in given states to maximize cumulative rewards.
- **State Representation**: The state of the game includes the position of the snake, the position of the food, and the direction of the snake.
- **Rewards**: The agent receives positive rewards for eating food and negative rewards for colliding with walls or itself.
